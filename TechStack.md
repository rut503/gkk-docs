# Back-End System : *FastAPI*
We will be using ***FastAPI***, which is a recent and popular Python library to build out the REST-Full back-end system for GKK product.

Tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXwcUrI-iss
FastAPI Website : https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
Documentation : https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

## Pros
- Python is short and simple and to the point. 
- Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
- Fast to code and Fewer bugs.
- Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
- Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
- ...

## Cons
- Not many great tutorials available online for FastAPI and MongoDB connection.
- ...


# Front-End System : *React Native*
We will be using ***React Native***, which is a subset of React.JS library built with JavaScript to build out the front-end system for GKK product. 

Tutorial : https://youtu.be/qSRrxpdMpVc  
React Native Wesite : https://reactnative.dev/  
Documentation : https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started  

## Pros
- Cross Platform, we can serve both iOS and Android users with one code base.
- Extremely similar to React.JS which makes it easy for front-end devs to create a web version of our app when needed.
- ...

## Cons
- Will need to be optimized for performance if the system gets complicated. 
- We will be dependent on Facebook to keep supporting this library.
- Flutter seems to be ahead of the cross platform game.
- ...


# Database System : *MongoDB*
We will be using ***MongoDB***, which is a NoSQL (Schemaless) Database used in modern systems to build out the database system for GKK product.

Tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VELru-FCWDM  
MongoDB Website : https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas  
Documentation : https://docs.mongodb.com/  

## Pros
- Easily Horizontally Scalable 
- Replicatable 
- Supper efficient when reading and writting to single collection
- MongoDB offeres a free product called **MongoDB Atlas** that is hosted on different cloud platforms and comes with built-in full automation. 
- This way, we don't have to restructure data models when the application needs changes. This approach allows data to be developed aroun application rather than in RDBMS application is built around data which isn't great.
- ...

## Cons
- No relationships between data (unless manually done)
- Poor efficiency when writting/changing same data in multiple collections
- ...
