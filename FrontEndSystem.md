## Front-End System : *React Native*
We will be using ***React Native***, which is a subset of React.JS library built with JavaScript to build out the front-end system for GKK product. 

React Native Wesite : https://reactnative.dev/

- Will need to be optimized for performance if the system gets complicated. 
- We will be dependent on Facebook to keep supporting this library.
- Flutter seems to be ahead of the cross platform game.
