2) Want consumers to search for food in their location, at a certain time.

Notes:
Whenever a new review is added, the averageRating value needs to be recalculated. 

Could make reviews a reference. 

Embedded = less queries but more data

*************************************************************************************************

When ever a food is added by a producer, the app assigns the Food document to the correct
array in the 'Location' collection. 
A query will push the food into the respective array. 

User Cases:

Use Case 1:
Consumer wants to find Chinese food on the 9th for breakfast. 
App would query the Location collection and find the document that corresponds
to the 9th. 

Use Case 2: 
Producer wants to add a new food to their menu.
App will add a Food docuemnts to that users Document food array. 

Concerns:
How will a consumer search for the best producers in a location?
